Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Fluff that up. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.

Let's get wild today. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.

A happy cloud. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You need the dark in order to show the light. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.

We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.
